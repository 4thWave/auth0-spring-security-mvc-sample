# Login

This example shows how to implement login functionality using Lock. Lock is an embeddable login form for desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

You can read a quickstart for this sample [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/java-spring-security-mvc/01-login). 

## Prerequisites

In order to run this example you will need to have Java 7+ and Maven installed.

Check that your maven version is 3.0.x or above:

```sh
mvn -v
```

## Configure callback URLs

Callback URLs are URLs that Auth0 invokes after the authentication process. Auth0 routes your application back to this URL and attaches some details to it including a token. Callback URLs can be manipulated on the fly and that could be harmful. For security reasons, you will need to add your application's URL in the client's `Allowed Callback URLs`. This will enable Auth0 to recognize the URLs as valid. If omitted, authentication will not be successful for the app instance.

The values you must configure are:
- Allowed Callback URL: `http://localhost:3099/callback`
- Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:3099/logout`

## Configure your Spring Security app

Your Spring Security app needs some information in order to authenticate against your Auth0 account. We have created a file for you but you need to update some of the entries with the valid values for your Client. The file is `/src/main/resources/auth0.properties` and it contains the following:

```
auth0.domain: {DOMAIN}
auth0.issuer: {ISSUER}
auth0.clientId: {CLIENT_ID}
auth0.clientSecret: {CLIENT_SECRET}
auth0.onLogoutRedirectTo: /login
auth0.securedRoute: /portal/*
auth0.loginCallback: /callback
auth0.loginRedirectOnSuccess: /portal/home
auth0.loginRedirectOnFail: /login
auth0.base64EncodedSecret: true
auth0.authorityStrategy: ROLES
auth0.servletFilterEnabled: false
auth0.defaultAuth0WebSecurityEnabled: false
auth0.connection: {CONNECTION}
auth0.customLogin: false
#auth0.customLogin: true
auth0.signingAlgorithm: HS256
#auth0.signingAlgorithm: RS256
#auth0.publicKeyPath: /WEB-INF/certificate/cert.pem
```

You need to change the following values:
- `auth0.domain`:	Your auth0 domain. You can find the correct value on the Settings tab of your client on the dashboard.
- `auth0.issuer`:	The issuer of the JWT Token. This is typically your auth0 domain with a `https://` prefix and a `/` suffix. For example, if your `auth0.domain` is `example.auth0.com` then the `auth0.issuer` should be set to `https://example.auth0.com/` (the trailing slash is important!).
- `auth0.clientId`:	The unique identifier for your client. You can find the correct value on the Settings tab of your client on the dashboard. 
- `auth0.clientSecret`:	The secret used to sign and validate the tokens that will be used in the different authentication flows. You can find the correct value on the Settings tab of your client on the dashboard.

If you download the seed from our [Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/java-spring-security-mvc/01-login) then the `domain`, `clientId` and `clientSecret` attributes will be populated for you, unless you are not logged in or you do not have at least one registered client. In any case you should verify that the values are correct if you have multiple clients in your account and you might want to use another than the one we set the information for. Do not forget to manually set the `issuer` attribute!

## Build and Run

In order to build and run the project execute:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then, go to [http://localhost:3099/login](http://localhost:3099/login). 

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

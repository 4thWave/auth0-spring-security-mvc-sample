# MFA

There are no code changes required to implement MFA, all you need to do is configure it to the Management Dashboard!

You can find a quickstart for MFA using Java Spring Security [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/java-spring-security-mvc/09-mfa) and more details on MFA and the supported methods [here](https://auth0.com/docs/multifactor-authentication).

If you want to see how it works using a sample project you can use [this](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-spring-security-mvc-sample/tree/master/01-Login).
